    "- The main purpose of QR decomposition is to ease the numerical calculation of eigenvalue, determinant, etc.\n",
    "- There seems to be no special geographic meaning, so it is not very important from mathematics point of view.\n",
    "- Many textbooks teach you to calculate $Q$ and $R$ by Gram-Schmidt process. It is easy to understand and you can apply it to manual calculation. However, it is prone to numerical error (due to limited accuracy of computer float number process).\n",
    "- From application point of view, I don't think mastering calculating QR decomposition by Gram-Schmidt process has any benefit, since you will certainly use computer to do the calcuation instead of manually. If you are a computer scientist trying to improve the algorithm efficiency and accuracy, Gram-Schmidt process is also not suitable due to its limit.\n",
